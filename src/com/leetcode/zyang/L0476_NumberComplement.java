 * 		   Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The
 *         complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * 
 *         Note: The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a
 *         32-bit signed integer. You could assume no leading zero bit in the
 *         integerâ€™s binary representation. 
 *         
 *         Example 1: Input: 5 Output: 2
 *         Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero
 *         bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2. 
 *         
 *         Example 2:
 *         Input: 1 Output: 0 
 *         Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1
 *         (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to
 *         output 0.

	//    highest 1 bit (100), left shift by 1 (1000), then subtract 1 from it (111)
