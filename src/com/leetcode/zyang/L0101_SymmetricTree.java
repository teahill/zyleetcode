 * Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
 * For example, this binary tree is symmetric:
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   2
 *  / \ / \
 * 3  4 4  3
 * But the following is not:
 *    1
 *   / \
 *  2   2
 *   \   \
 *   3    3
 *   
 *   Note:
 *   
 *   Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.
 *   confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
