/**
 * @author zyang
 * 
 *         Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)
 *         of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's
 *         h-index.
 * 
 *         According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
 *         "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, 
 *         and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * 
 *         For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the
 *         researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0,
 *         6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers
 *         with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more
 *         than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
 * 
 *         Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is
 *         taken as the h-index.
